- A2 authentication
  - set session name
  - identify session id in non-usual places
  - session attacks
  - 

- integration in burp:
  - button in FF "attack with sentinel" ?

- Parameter Pollution
  - add arbitrary param
- json viewer
- json browser
  - for adding params
  - test if its type is really JSON?

- standalone sentinel version

- lists:
  ? should be possible to add decoded string for attack lists (xss)
  - list entries are usually not encoded - need to encode if sent in GET?
  - or not?

+ "add to sentinel" in panelright popup

- attacklists "Test" and "Result" in panelright are "Null"
- make decoder indicator better (no string)
  - also in panelright (attack)
- insert fucked up json delimiter on attackother };
- export:
  - copy paste csnc style
  - interoperability style
- allow multiple changeParam in HttpParam
- remove changeparam from httpMessage.getReq()
- create repeater implementation
- remove old selections in PanelLeftPopup.decodeIt()
- delete virtparam in panelleft

Overall:
- generate report
- add tooltip to everything
- attack variable names?
- adding a message is a little bit strange because of onaddrow on topview
- tab name should "blink" if sent to sentinel
  - how to?
- log window - popup on mouseover?
- manually follow 302 with button

Feature:
+ fast diff two responses from panelright (to check difference between SQLi)
- copy-paste should be colorful! (and working...)
- implement session manager for burp

Bugfixes:
- change background color of lines of header, bold interesting one's

Todo CSNC:
- search: auto scroll to match
  - combobox?
  - popupmenu
- smart request copy
  - copy only relevant parts of request/response (viewstate nooot), with highlights
- session manager: make it global, add tab to request/reponse tab?
- make session ui more usable
  + remove a session
  - session from burp
+ save/restore messages
- color backgrounds of buttons according to vuln (red, yellow)
? make go button in table

Todo HOME:
Main usability features:
- beautify modifies source, breaks attacks
- change index scroll thingies to line number, not offset whereever possible
- reset message header info upon changing to request?
- adjust syntax parser to highlight params
- fix urldecode on rightpanel
- implement other tooltips
- make color choosable
  - fix selection color
- select part of response to indicate stuff
+ implement html beautifier
- color attack backgrounds
  - (new)
  - tested          green
  - vulnerable      yellow
  - interesting     red
- make tooltip urldecode / or opposite correctly
- tooltips header/body
- limit view to successful attacks only 


attackother:
  - move GET to post/nonurlencoded (optional)
  - add GET to post/nonurlenced (optional)


Sunday test 0:
- cleanup attackresult / attackdata
  - where to store the enum?
  - isSuccess() to the enum?
- upon remove() message, also remove bot shit
- upon remove() message, do not adjust index #

Monday test 0:
- row width f√ºr attack/retlen: automatisch berechnen (minimal)
- make load time relative to initial?
- XSS vuln should only check in body, not in header? (Location: blablabla&a=<p>"
- when resizing bot split pane - how keep it for next requests?
- burp: on parameters, only on click will combobox be available - make this too?
- request: for ?a&b&c, abc are not names, but values!

Internal test 0:
- move vulns to params, not messages (to cleanup hasVulns in panelleftui)
- integrate scan dialog into ui, not seperate window
- omfg, redo attack shizzle
  - PanelLeftTableModel: createChangeParam should NOT change original message


Big features:
  + diff between 2 window - highlighted only?
  - important param
  - generate overall report
  - only view tags/content/all
  - if no answer on sending request, how to display?
  - translate to new menu interface
  - usually set parent in topui/botui for interface with gui - maybe global?
  
  
Think:
  - httpmessage: set parent in constructor?
  - replace orig param, or add attack?
  - if XSS0 ok and XSS1 ok, why still display XSS0?
  - highlight ALL params in leftui?
  - on redirectds - should request be initial request, or request of redir?


Questions:
  - invokelater for maingui?
  - invokelater for sendtosentinel?
