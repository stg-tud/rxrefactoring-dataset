JabRef is a graphical application for managing bibliographical data.

* Homepage: http://jabref.sourceforge.net/
* Development page: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jabref/
* Main git repository: `git://git.code.sf.net/p/jabref/code` / https://sourceforge.net/p/jabref/code/ci/master/tree/

There is a github mirror at https://github.com/JabRef/jabref. This repository is a rewrite of the original repository containing the `jabref` folder only. Although this changes **all** git commit ids, the advantage is to have a clean separation between plugins, the homepage and the code of JabRef.
