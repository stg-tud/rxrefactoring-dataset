    <title>Polygraph package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a small package that we use for building tests. Polygraph stands for <strong>poly</strong>gonal
    <strong>graph</strong>ics.</p>

<p>We don't use nodebox.graphics because we don't want to force a dependency on that package.</p>

<p>This code is small enough to allow various test cases, and can be modified without breaking the tests.</p>

<p>The code is correct but unlikely to be useful, since it doesn't draw anything.</p>
