Installing NodeBox
==================
If you're only interested in running NodeBox, precompiled binaries for Windows and Mac are available at http://beta.nodebox.net/download .

Mac OS X
========
1. Install Git. I use http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3 but you can use MacPorts or HomeBrew as well.
2. Open Terminal (in Applications/Utilities)  and type the following commands to clone and build the project:

 git clone git://github.com/nodebox/nodebox.git
 cd nodebox
 ant dist-mac

3. Open the "dist" folder under the NodeBox project folder, right-click the "mac" folder and select "Compress". Rename the archive to also contain the version number, e.g. NodeBox-2.0.963.zip. Note that using the "zip" command from the terminal creates an invalid executable.

Windows
=======
1. Install Msysgit from http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list . During setup, indicate you want to use Unix-style line endings.
2. Install Java JDK from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp . We install the JDK under c:\java\jdk6 and the JRE under c:\java\jre6. Note the directory where you've installed the JRE.
3. Install Unicode NSIS from http://www.scratchpaper.com/home/downloads . Note the directory where you've installed it (normally c:\Program Files\NSIS\Unicode).
4. If you use the command line, download and install the latest Apache Ant from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi . Configure JDK_HOME and ANT_HOME under System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
5. If you use an IDE, configure it to use the build.xml file in the root.
6. Configure the path to NSIS and the Java JRE in build.properties.
7. Set the version number in src/main/resources/version.properties.
8. Run the dist-win Ant target. This will create an installer with the given version number under "dist".

Linux
=====
The following commands will install the correct prerequisites and clone and run the project: 

 sudo apt-get install git-core openjdk-6-jdk ant
 git clone git://github.com/nodebox/nodebox.git
 cd nodebox
 ant run
